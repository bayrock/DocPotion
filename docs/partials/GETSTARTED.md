## Getting Started:
1. Install [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)
2. Add and configure [layouts](https://github.com/bayrock/docpotion/tree/main/docs/layouts) and [partials](https://github.com/bayrock/docpotion/tree/main/docs/partials)
3. Run the script:
```
> cd docs
> elixir DocPotion.exs
```

All done! Full document files are written to the root directory by default.
